## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and intervention can save lives. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict heart attack risks based on various health indicators and features extracted from the dataset.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Understanding and visualizing the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing data.
- **Standardization:** Normalizing the data for better model performance.
- **Model Building:** Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **AutoML with EvalML:** Using EvalML to automate model selection and tuning.
- **Prediction:** Making predictions on new data.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib evalml
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-attack-risk-predictor.git
